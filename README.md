Plugins are for the youth group minecraft server.

Sign Shops:

Sign shops are declared with "Shop" in the first line.
By default signs sell and buy the block beneth it.
The second line is for a material id if you want to overide the default setting.
The third line is for the plugin to be able to tell the player what they're buying/selling.
The last line is the buy price. The sell price is 25% of the buy price.

Amethyst Converters:

Amethyst Converters also are "sign shops"
To declare them type: "Converter" in the first line.

The third and fourth line are the same as a normal shop.
The only difference for a Amethyst converter is that the sell price is the same as the buy price.
